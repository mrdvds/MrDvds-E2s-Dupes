Welcome To My Public Back To The Future Delorean!
Here I list iussues that many people would maybe ask.

1: Why is there errors?, Sub To All Addons On This https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=390798140, And This https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027256228&searchtext=lvs, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2912816023&searchtext=lvs, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027255911&searchtext=lvs

2: Wheres the bttf3 or bttf3 rail delorean?, I have made on but i cant sadly make it public because the time circut prop is made by snowy and said i cant give it out, sorry.

3: Why does it break on some servers the wheels are dr.fussion!?, For some reason Az's Pack broke and the delorean would mostly break on servers like fc&n, Move to a server called Ts200 or Nat but they dont have lvs so you might have to wait (Server Ips Ts200: 47.34.144.56:27015 Nat: 76.118.116.140:27016) And if your going to join by console comand do "connect" and then space, it sould look like this "connect 47.34.144.56:27015"

4: Will do you a tutoral on how to use your time travel e2, yeah soon.
